    "COS Data can be taken in [`TIME-TAG`](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-1-cos-overview/1-1-instrument-capabilities-and-design) mode, in which each individual encounter with a photon is recorded with its own metadata such as the time of the encounter. You may wish to split a COS exposure into multiple sub-exposure files. For instance, a transit may occur during your exposure, and you may wish to see the difference between the source's spectrum before, during, and after the transit. This is possible with `TIME-TAG` data, and the functionality to do this is built into the [`COSTools` python module](https://github.com/spacetelescope/costools) with the tool `splittag`. \n",
