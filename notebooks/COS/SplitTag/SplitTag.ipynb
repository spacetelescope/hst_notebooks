You may wish to split a COS exposure into multiple sub-exposure files. For instance, a transit may occur during your exposure, and you may wish to see the difference between the source's spectrum before, during, and after the transit. This is possible with `TIME-TAG` data, and the functionality to do this is built into the [`COSTools` python module](https://github.com/spacetelescope/costools) with the tool `splittag`. \n",
