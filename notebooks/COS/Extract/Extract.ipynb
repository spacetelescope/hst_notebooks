    "The raw data from the COS instrument is a series of events, each corresponding to a photon interacting with the detector at a specific X, Y point, (*and at a specific time if in `TIME-TAG` mode*). We generally wish to translate this to a 1-dimensional spectrum (***Flux** or Intensity on the y axis vs. **Wavelength** on the x axis*). To do this, we can first make a 2-dimensional spectrum, by plotting all the X and Y points of the spectrum onto a 2D image of the detector. The different spectra (i.e. of the NUV of FUV target, the wavelength calibration source) then appear of stripes of high count density on this image. We can then simply draw extraction boxes around these stripes, and integrate to collapse the data onto the wavelenth axis.\n",

For each combination of COS lifetime position, grating, cenwave, etc., the extraction box is specified by giving the slope and y-intercept of a line, and the height of the parallelogram which should be centered on the line. Similar boxes are specified for background regions. For more information on the `XTRACTAB`, see the [COS Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-3-cos-calibration/3-7-reference-files#id-3.7ReferenceFiles-3.7.12XTRACTAB:1-DSpectralExtractionTablehttps://hst-docs.stsci.edu/cosdhb/chapter-3-cos-calibration/3-7-reference-files#id-3.7ReferenceFiles-3.7.12XTRACTAB:1-DSpectralExtractionTable)."
