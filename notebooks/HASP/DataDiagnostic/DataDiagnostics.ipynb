    "The [Hubble Advanced Spectral Products (HASP) `coadd` code](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hasp) is a script that co-adds spectra of the same target within a program. This software is able to co-add data taken with the spectrographs onboard the [Hubble Space Telescope (HST)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst); the [Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/stis) and the [Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/cos). The [Hubble Spectroscopic Legacy Archive (HSLA)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/hst/hasp) uses this script to co-add these instruments’ data from [The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/) to create high-quality spectra with a broad wavelength coverage (whenever possible from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared) that is publicly available for the scientific community. The script first co-adds the observations for each grating for a given visit, then it combines all gratings for the observation set. Finally, it co-adds the spectra of each observation set in the program to produce a fully co-added spectra for each target in a program. [Check out the COS 2024-1 ISR for more information about the HASP script and products](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/cos/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/ISR2024-01.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data fed into the `coadd` code from each program are selected via a MAST archive search query. This query performs some filtering at the same time and rejects certain bad quality datasets. Then, the `coadd` script itself performs another series of checks on the input spectra before computing the co-added data products. Lastly, while `coadd` is running, it will check the flux of the input data in each wavelength bin for a given mode against an initial coadd that includes all input data. If the median flux of an input spectrum is lower than a given threshold against the co-add, it will be removed. `coadd` will iterate until no more spectra are rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different reasons an exposure could be rejected before the co-addition is running. These fall into three categories. First, the data in a given program may have quality issues that lead to its removal. Second, there are some observation configurations that `coadd` is not equipped to handle. Last, the target itself may pose an issue, such as for moving targets, or the target flux may be intrinsically variable, making the `coadd` flux filter reject good spectra. Finer details of these rejection criteria are summarized below:\n",

    "As stated in the introduction, files can be removed from the co-added products in three steps. First, some files are excluded via a MAST archive query before they are even fed into `coadd`. Everything in the log file above the line that states `HASP version X.X` is output from this query. So, in this example, we can see that all but one of the files from MAST were fed into the `coadd` script. The rootname of the file (`lbui11faq`) and the reason for its removal by MAST are shown and we will take a closer look at the reason later. The rest of the log file gives the output from `coadd` itself. The `coadd` script output will indicate when a file is removed, giving both the filename and the reason, below the line that states `Ullyses version X.X.X`. Typically, data with observing issues are removed by the MAST query, while observation or target parameter issues are removed in `coadd`. Looking through the log file, we can see 9 other files were removed by `coadd` in this program:\n",

We already knew the files in Visit 51 were removed by `coadd` (and why) by looking at the output log above. The file from Visit 11 (`lbui11faq_x1d.fits`) was removed by the MAST query due to \"low quality.\" We can investigate the rejections from both visits further by inspecting the header keywords of the input spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following cell, we make a function to read the file headers for each input spectrum. Most of the reasons for rejection that are listed in the [Introduction](#introduction) section can be found either in the primary or first extension headers. This function can be used to inspect both COS and STIS extracted data, both `x1d` or `sx1` files. Note that some keywords, such as those describing the offset patterns, are only included in STIS files.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few other keywords not listed in the [Introduction](#introduction) that are useful to assess as well. These include the quality comments (`QUALCOM1`, `QUALCOM2`, `QUALCOM3`), the file date (`DATE`), and calibration software version (`CAL_VER`). \n",
    "\n",
    "The quality comments can hold information about the quality of a dataset. For example, they may have phrases like `Guide star acquisition failed. Actual guide mode is gyro` or `COS internal shutter closed. No counts in exposure`. If there is nothing to note for the dataset, the quality comments will be blank, but note that sometimes this can be inaccurate, as it relies on PIs to file problem reports. For STIS, these keys are in the `x1d` or `sx1` file headers. For COS, they are located in the `x1dsum` files that CalCOS creates, which are the sum of `FP-POS` exposures for a given observing mode in each visit. While these keywords do exist in COS `x1d` files, they will only be populated with comments in the `x1dsums`. To find the `x1dsum` file for these observations, we can use the `ASN_ID` keyword from the `x1ds`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The date the file was written and the version of the software used for calibration are useful for finding datasets that are archived \"statically\" in MAST, meaning they are always excluded from re-calibration because doing so will crash the latest versions of the calibration pipeline. There are only a handful of statically archived datasets for COS and STIS. The reasons they need to be designated as such are usually due to detector or spacecraft issues that need very specialized processing, and this is not always captured in the quality comments. Therefore, we do not recommend using these datasets in co-adds."
