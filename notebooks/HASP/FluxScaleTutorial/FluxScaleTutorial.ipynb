    "The [Hubble Advanced Spectral Products (HASP)](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hasp) code is a script that co-adds spectra within programs. It currently is able to co-add data from the [Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/stis) and the [Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/cos) instruments onboard the [Hubble Space Telescope (HST)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst). The [Hubble Spectroscopic Legacy Archive (HSLA)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/hst/hasp) uses this script to co-add these instrumentsâ€™ data from the [The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/) archive to make high quality, wide wavelength UV spectra that is publicly available for the scientific community. These custom co-addition notebooks will instruct users on how produce their own co-adds in cases where the MAST archive data needs special processing or is rejected. \n",
    "\n",
    "The script first co-adds a program's observation set spectra for each grating, then it combines all gratings for the observation set. Finally, it co-adds the spectra of each observation set in the program to produce a fully co-added spectra for each target in a program. lease check out the [COS 2024-01 ISR](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/cos/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/ISR2024-01.pdf) for more information about HASP.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the process of co-adding data, the script will also check the flux of input data in each wavelength bin for a given mode against a first coadd that includes all of the input spectra. If the median flux of an input spectrum is lower than a given threshold against the co-add, it will be removed and the program iterates until no more spectra are rejected. This is to prevent data from failed observations from being co-added, but it will also impact sources  that are variable. Additionally for extended sources, the amount of light collected by the PSA on COS may be different from a STIS aperture, which could create flux offsets between gratings. Finally, some of the small apertures for STIS can be impacted by changes in observatory focus and create flux offsets. Similarly, extended sources that are observed at multiple orientations may have slight variations in flux. If a user's science case is not dependent on the accuracy of a dataset's absolute flux, scaling input spectra to be the same average or median flux may be desirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will go into depth about checking for variability in a set of data, scaling data to a common median flux, running the co-add script, and inspecting the output by plotting flux as a function of wavelength. This notebook assumes that the user has very little experience with Python but is already familiar with the basic usage of the co-add script; users who are more experienced and would just like to learn how to run and download the script can checkout the [Setup.ipynb](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hst_notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/HASP/Setup) notebook in this repository. Less experienced users should first run the [CoaddTutorial.ipynb](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hst_notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/HASP/CoaddTutorial) notebook in this repository."
