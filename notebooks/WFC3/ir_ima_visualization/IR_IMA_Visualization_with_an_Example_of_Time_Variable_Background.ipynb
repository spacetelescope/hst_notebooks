These visualization tools may be used to identify issues with the data, for example, a [guidestar (GS) failure](https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/mastpreview?mission=hst&dataid=ID7002010), a [satellite trail](https://archive.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/mastpreview?mission=hst&dataid=IB5X02030) in a specific read, or time variable background, which may take the form of scattered light or He I 10830 Å airglow line emission. \n",

    "**Observing with the WFC3/IR MULTIACCUM Mode**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed in section [7.7 of the WFC3 Instrument Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3ihb/chapter-7-ir-imaging-with-wfc3/7-7-ir-exposure-and-readout), the only observing mode available for the WFC3/IR channel is the MULTIACCUM mode, which samples the signal multiple times as an exposure accumulates. Exposures are taken in \"a sequence of non-destructive reads specified by the user from a variety of pre-defined configurations with both constant (SPARS) and increasing (STEP) time intervals between subsequent reads. At the time of each read,\n",
    "the accumulated charge on each pixel is recorded and this charge accumulation history for\n",
    "a given exposure — the 'ramp' — is recorded in the RAW data files.\" The maximum number of reads (following the zero read) during an exposure is 15, which are collected as the signal ramps up.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple readouts in the MULTIACCUM mode are advantageous for three key reasons. First, they increase the dynamic range of the image. The signal in a pixel that is saturated by the end of the exposure is recorded multiple times, including before saturation. Second, cosmic-ray events that occur throughout the exposure can be anaylzed and identified in individual reads and subsequently removed. Finally, by fitting to multiple reads, one can reduce the effective read noise in an observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "See section [7.7 of the WFC3 Instrument Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3ihb/chapter-7-ir-imaging-with-wfc3/7-7-ir-exposure-and-readout) for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time-Variable Background in the WFC3/IR Channel**\n",
    "\n",
    "In WFC3/IR images, the sky background may be comprised of one or more of the following components: zodiacal light, [scattered light from the bright Earth limb](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb/chapter-7-wfc3-ir-sources-of-error/7-10-time-variable-background), and [He I 10830 Å airglow line emission](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb/chapter-7-wfc3-ir-sources-of-error/7-10-time-variable-background) from helium atoms excited by sunlight in the Earth's upper atmosphere. The zodiacal light, which depends on the orientation of the target with respect to the sun, varies throughout the year but is effectively constant within a given exposure/orbit/visit. However, the scattered light and line emission components can vary within an orbit and even within a single exposure, leading to a background that varies with time. In this notebook, we will show an example of time-variable background due to Earth limb scattered light (made when HST is pointing near the bright Earth limb), which results in a spatially variable signal with the leftmost (x<400) columns of the detector being subject to background levels up to twice as bright as that on the rest of the chip.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following sections, we show how to identify the impacted reads. In future [WFC3 Library](https://github.com/spacetelescope/WFC3Library) notebooks, Correcting for Scattered Light in WFC3/IR Exposures: Using `calwf3` to Exclude Bad Reads (O'Connor, in prep.) and Correcting for Scattered Light in IR Exposures: Manually Excluding Bad Reads (O'Connor, in prep.), we show how to reprocess the exposure while excluding those reads. Here, we show how to compute and plot the median background rate (e.g. the difference between IMA reads) and we compare the background in different regions of the detector.  \n",
    "\n",
    "See section [7.10 of the WFC3 Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb/chapter-7-wfc3-ir-sources-of-error/7-10-time-variable-background) for more details."

In this case, the difference between the two sides of the image is due to scattered light which varies spatially across the detector. We know the time-variable component is only due to Earth limb scattered light because this filter (F140W) is not affected by the He I 10830 Å airglow line emission (see section [7.10.2 of the WFC3 Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb/chapter-7-wfc3-ir-sources-of-error/7-10-time-variable-background)).
