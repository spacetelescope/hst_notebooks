    "\n",
    "The v1.0 pixel-based Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) correction was first implemented into `calwf3` `v3.3` in 2016 <br> ([Ryan et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016wfc..rept....1R/abstract), [Anderson & Bedin 2010](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PASP..122.1035A/abstract), [HSTCAL release notes](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hstcal/releases/tag/1.0.0)). This also marked the first time users could directly <br> download CTE-corrected `flc & drc` files from [MAST](https://mast.stsci.edu/search/hst/ui/#/).  While the v1.0 correction was sufficient  for many years, the <br> degradation of CTE over time reduced the efficacy of the model in treating low-level pixels. The v1.0 correction adversely <br> impacts (overcorrects) both the image background and faint sources. In April 2021 the v2.0 pixel-based CTE correction <br> was implemented in `calwf3` `v3.6.0` ([Anderson et al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021wfc..rept....9A/abstract), [Kuhn & Anderson 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021wfc..rept....6K/abstract),  [HSTCAL release notes](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hstcal/releases/tag/2.7.0)). Since <br> MAST uses the latest release of `calwf3` for calibration, any WFC3/UVIS CTE corrected data retrieved from MAST, <br> regardless of observation date, will be calibrated with the v2.0 pixel-based CTE correction. Although v1.0 pixel-based <br> CTE-corrected `flc & drc` files are no longer accessable through MAST, this notebook steps through the procedure <br> required to calibrate WFC3/UVIS images using the v1.0 CTE correction. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the limiting factors of using the v1.0 CTE correction are the CTE corrected dark current reference files (`DRKCFILE`). <br> These dark reference files are delivered to MAST by the WFC3 team and use the same pixel-based CTE correction within <br> `calwf3`. Now that we have switched to the v2.0 CTE correction there is a cut off for dark current reference files that use <br> the v1.0 correction. Observations taken after February 2021 will not have CTE corrected dark files using the v1.0 algorithm, <br> which means **applying the v1.0 CTE correction works best for observations taken between May 2009 - February 2021.** <br> If the observation being calibrated was taken after February 2021 there are two options: **1)** use the last v1.0 CTE corrected <br> dark reference file from February 2021 or **2)** use the v2.0 CTE corrected dark with the most appropriate `USEAFTER` for the <br> science exposure's observation date.

    "The first plot below shows the measured flux of the six stars in each of the different calibrated products. Stars 1-6 are organized <br> by increasing flux, with Star 1 being the faintest and Star 6 being the brightest. The x-axis values correspond to the median flux <br> value measured in each of the three different files (FLT, v1.0, and v2.0) per star. The y-axis values show the individual flux values <br> for each star where the different colors and symbols represent the three file types. For example, the individual flux values (y-axis) <br> of Star 1 for the FLT, v1.0, and v2.0 files are ~2467, 3056, and 2799 e- respectively. The median of the three values is ~2799 e-, <br> which is the value plotted on the x-axis. The second plot illustrates the percent differences between the three different <br> flux values per star, and uses the same x-axis values as the first plot. <br> \n",

    "The FLT files have no CTE correction applied and thus have the lowest measured flux for each star due to the CTE flux loss. <br> Stars 1-4 have noticably different flux values between the v1.0 and v2.0 CTE corrections. In v1.0, the CTE algorithm is actually <br> over-correcting these fainter sources resulting in higher aperture photometry measurements. The flux values for stars 1-4 range <br> from  ~3000 - 10000 e- within a 3-pixel radius aperture. The flux values between the v1.0 and v2.0 CTE corrections for stars <br> 1-4 have percent differences of ~9 - 4%. Sources with more than ~10000 e- within a 3-pixel aperture (stars 5 & 6) have more <br> compareable flux values between the v1.0 and v2.0 CTE corrections, and have percent differences less than 2%."
