In this tutorial, we present `display_image`, a tool for displaying full images with metadata, individual WFC3/UVIS chip images, a section of an image with various colormaps/scaling, and individual WFC3/IR `ima` reads. In addition, we present `row_column_stats`, a tool for computing row and column statistics for the types of WFC3 images previously mentioned.

This directory, once unzipped, should contain this `README.md`,
the image displayer tool `display_image.py`, the row and column statistic
tool `row_column_stats.py`, and the Jupyter Notebook tutorial
`wfc3_imageanalysis.ipynb`. Both of these tools are meant to be used inside of
a Jupyter Notebook.

In order to run the Jupyter Notebook you must create the virtual
environment in [WFC3 Library's](https://github.com/spacetelescope/WFC3Library)
installation instructions. No additional packages are required to run this
Jupyter Notebook.

These tools (specifically `display_image`) look much better in Jupyter Lab
rather than the classic Jupyter Notebook.  If your environment has Jupyter Lab
installed it's recommended you use that to run the `.ipynb` file. If you're
interested in adding Jupyter Lab to your environment see the install
instructions on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

Questions or concerns should be sent to the [HST Help Desk](https://stsci.service-now.com/hst).
