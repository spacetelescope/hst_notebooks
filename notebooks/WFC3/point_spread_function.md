# HST WFC3 Point Spread Function Modeling
Here are brief descriptions of the WFC3 Notebooks for Point Spread Function modeling.

## HST Point Spread Function
This notebook demonstrates how to generate Point Spread Function (PSF) 
models for WFC3 observations. This includes retrieving empirical models 
from the [WFC3 PSF Website](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=wfc3+psf&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8), generating custom models by stacking stars, 
and retrieving cutouts from the [MAST PSF Database](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/data-analysis/psf/psf-search). The notebook 
includes examples of how to generate stellar catalogs, perform PSF fitting 
and subtraction, and how to utilize differe types of PSF models depending 
on the available data and science goals. While the examples are focused 
on WFC3, the notebook can also be used with ACS, WFPC2, and other instruments.
