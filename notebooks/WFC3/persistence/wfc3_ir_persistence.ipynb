    "This notebook shows how to use the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/IR persistence model to flag pixels affected by persistence in the calibrated (FLT) science images. When the images are sufficiently dithered to step over the observed persistence artifacts, AstroDrizzle may be used to exclude those flagged pixels when combining the FLT frames. \n",

    "## Introduction <a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Image persistence in the IR array occurs whenever a pixel is exposed to light that exceeds more than about half of the full well of a pixel in the array. Persistence can occur within a single visit, as the different exposures in a visit are dithered. Persistence also occurs from observations in a previous visit of completely different fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Image persistence is seen in a small, but non-negligible fraction of WFC3/IR exposures. Its properties are discussed in in [Section 5.7.9](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3ihb/chapter-5-wfc3-detector-characteristics-and-performance/5-7-ir-detector-characteristics-and-performance#id-5.7IRDetectorCharacteristicsandPerformance-5.7.95.7.9ImagePersistence) of the WFC3 Instrument Handbook and in [Chapter 8](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb/chapter-8-persistence-in-wfc3-ir) of the WFC3 Data Handbook. Persistence is primarily a function of the degree to which a pixel is filled (in electrons) and the time since this occurred. Additional information is available from the [WFC3 Persistence Webpage](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/data-analysis/ir-persistence).\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in [Section 8.3](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb/chapter-8-persistence-in-wfc3-ir/8-3-mitigating-the-effects-of-persistence) of the Data Handbook, there are two possible ways to mitigate persistence: 1.) exclude the affected pixels from the analysis or 2.) subtract the persistence model directly from the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates the first method and shows how to use model to flag affected pixels in the data quality (DQ) array of each FLT image. When the images are sufficiently dithered, affected regions of the detector may be replaced with 'good' pixels from other exposures in the visit when combining the exposures with AstroDrizzle. Note that this reduces the effective exposure time in those regions of the combined image. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second method, the persistence-corrected FLT frames, downloaded in [Section 2.2](#model) of this notebook, may be used directly for analysis or a scaled version of the persistence model may be subtracted from each FLT image until an adequate correction is achieved. In this case, flagging the affected pixels in the DQ arrays would not be required."
