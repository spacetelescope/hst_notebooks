    "# Correcting for Helium Line Emission Background in IR Exposures using the \"Flatten-Ramp\" Technique\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "This notebook shows how to identify IR exposures with time-variable Helium (1.083 micron) line emission background, and how to correct for it using the \"flatten-ramp\" technique. This method can be used to correct images affected by a sky background that does not vary across the field of view.  For recommendations on correcting for spatially variable background due to scattered light, see the [IR IMA Visualization Notebook](https://github.com/spacetelescope/WFC3Library/tree/master/notebooks/ir_ima_visualization) (O'Connor 2023).\n",

    "## Introduction <a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Helium I emission from the Earth's atmosphere may affect exposures taken in the F105W and F110W filters. Affected  reads are typically taken closest in time to when the spacecraft leaves the Earth's shadow and enters the illuminated atmosphere. The 1.083 micron emission produces a flat background signal which is added to the total background in affected reads. The strength of the emission background signal depends on the observed path-length through the illuminated atmosphere, and in some cases is strong enough to compromise the ramp fitting calibration performed by `calwf3`, which is initially designed to flag and remove cosmic rays and saturated reads as they come through. This results in the FLT image to have much larger noise and a non-gaussian sky background.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates multiple ways on how to identify exposures with time variable background, and how to correct for these additional noise through the usage of the \"flatten-ramp\" technique described in [WFC3 ISR 2016-16](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2016/WFC3-2016-16.pdf). This technique turns off ramp fitting in `calwf3` and treats the IR detector like a CCD detector to avoid flagging and removing cosmic rays. We then remove the median background per read and add back in the full exposure countrate to preserve pixel statistics and then rerun `calwf3` on the resulting IMA file with ramp fitting turned back on. This results in a cosmic-ray and time variable background corrected FLT file.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternate approach is the 'last-minus-first' technique described in the following [CALWF3 notebook](https://github.com/spacetelescope/WFC3Library/tree/master/notebooks/calwf3_recalibration). This turns off the ramp fitting step in `calwf3` (CRCORR=omit), treating the IR detector like a CCD accumulating charge and read out only at the end of the exposure. In this approach, the observed count rate is determined by simply subtracting the first read from the last of the detector and dividing by the time elapsed between the two reads. A disadvantage of this method is that this leaves cosmic-rays in the calibrated FLT frames which must be rejected with other software, such as AstroDrizzle.  However, this approach may be used for extended targets and crowded stellar fields where it may be difficult to detangle the sky background from the light from astronomical sources using simple median statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time variable background also affects IR grisms. However, the method in this notebook should not be used to correct G102 and G141 observations, as they are affected by a combination of Helium I and Zodiacal background. Details on correcting grism data is provided in [WFC3 ISR 2017-05: Variable He I emission in grism data](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2017/WFC3-2017-05.pdf).\n",
