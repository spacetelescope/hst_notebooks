In this Jupyter Notebook tutorial, we present the steps that should be taken
when an observer receives a WFC3 Exception Report Email.

This directory, once downloaded, should contain this README.md, the tutorial
Jupyter Notebook `wfc3_exception_report.ipynb`, an `html` copy of the notebook,
and a subdirectory titled `docs`. The subdirectory should contain two `.py`
files, one `.png`, and one `.gif` file that are used in the notebook.

In order to run this Jupyter Notebook, you must have created a virtual
environment, such as the one in [WFC3 Library's](https://github.com/spacetelescope/WFC3Library) installation instructions. If
you are using the `wfc3_env` environment from the `wfc3_env_legacy.yml` file in the
WFC3Library repository, then you should not need any other packages to run this
notebook.

Optional Note: The tools in this notebook (specifically display_image) look much
better in Jupyter Lab rather than in the classic Jupyter Notebook. If your
environment has Jupyter Lab installed it's recommended you use that to run the
.ipynb file. If you're interested in adding Jupyter Lab to your environment see
the install instructions on the [Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/install).

Please submit any questions or comments to the [WFC3 Help Desk](https://stsci.service-now.com/hst).
