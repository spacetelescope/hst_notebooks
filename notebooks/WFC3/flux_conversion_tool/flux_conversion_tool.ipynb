    "***\n",
    "## Learning Goals\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform conversions between various systems of flux and magnitude using the `synphot` and `stsynphot` packages.\n",
    "- Extrapolate an output flux at a different wavelength than the input flux, by using a spectrum defined using the same packages.\n",
    "- Provide a framework to adapt a more personalized and streamlined conversion process, if desired.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is based on the prior \"HST Photometric Conversion Tool\" that returns unit conversions between various flux units and magnitude systems. It is not intended to replace more detailed functionality such as that provided by the [Exposure Time Calculator](https://etc.stsci.edu/) (ETC). Rather, it is intended to provide a simple, quick result for flux unit conversions.\n",

    "`stsynphot` requires access to data distributed by the [Calibration Data Reference System](https://hst-crds.stsci.edu/) (CRDS) in order to operate. Both packages look for an environment variable called `PYSYN_CDBS` to find the directory containing these data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users can obtain these data files from the CDRS. Information on how to obtain the most up-to-date reference files (and what they contain) can be found [here](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/reference-data-for-calibration-and-tools/synphot-throughput-tables). An example of how to download these files using `curl` and set up this environment variable is presented in the imports section below.\n",

    "- *astropy.units* and *synphot.units* for handling units\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we will need to set the `PYSYN_CDBS` environment variable *before* importing stsynphot. We will also create a Vega spectrum using synphot's inbuilt `from_vega()` method, as the latter package will supercede this method's functionality and require a downloaded copy of the latest Vega spectrum to be provided."

Note the negative sign in front of the power law index $\\alpha$. The model can generate curves with $x$ as either frequency or wavelength, but the example here assumes that wavelength will be used. The y-axis unit will be taken from $A$. \n",

    "- Extrapolating an output flux at a different wavelength than the input flux.\n",
