    "This notebook is based on the prior \"HST Photometric Conversion Tool\" that returns unit conversions between various flux units and magnitude systems. It is not intended to replace more detailed functionality such as that provided by the [Exposure Time Calculator](https://etc.stsci.edu/) (ETC). Rather, it is intended to provide a simple, quick result for flux unit conversions.\n",

    "`stsynphot` requires access to data distributed by the [Calibration Data Reference System](https://hst-crds.stsci.edu/) (CRDS) in order to operate. Both packages look for an environment variable called `PYSYN_CDBS` to find the directory containing these data.\n",
    "\n",

Information on how to obtain the most up-to-date reference files (and what they contain) can be found [here](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/reference-data-for-calibration-and-tools/synphot-throughput-tables). An example of how to download these files using `curl` and set up this environment variable is presented in the imports section below.\n",

The pivot wavelength for that bandpass will then serve as the characteristic wavelength to be used for the conversion.\n",

As an example, `'wfc3, uvis2, f475w, mjd#59367'` tells `stsynphot` to retrieve the latest throughput tables for the UVIS2 detector on WFC3, through the F475W filter for the Modified Julian Date 59367 (June 1, 2021). The option to specify a Julian date is provided for instruments which show changes in sensitivity over time. If no date is specified, `stsynphot` will use the reference epoch for each instrument as default.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the required and optional obsmode keywords vary from instrument to instrument, it would be impractical to list the available options here in their entirety. Please refer to the [full list](https://stsynphot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/stsynphot/appendixb.html#stsynphot-appendixb) of available obsmode keywords for details on how to specify HST bandpasses.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- `synphot.models.BlackBody1D` outputs a function according to Planck's law, which means that the output unit carries an implicit \"per unit solid angle,\" in steradians. For a normalized blackbody, you can use `BlackBodyNorm1D`, whose output is normalized to a 1 solar radius star at a distance of 1 kpc, or multiply your source spectrum by some solid angle of your choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `synphot.models.PowerLawFlux1D` uses the definition $f(x) = A (\\frac{x}{x_0})^{-\\alpha}$, where $A$ is input flux (`flux_in`), and $x_0$ is the input wavelength (`wavelength_in`). Note the negative sign in front of the power law index $\\alpha$. The model can generate curves with $x$ as either frequency or wavelength, but the example here assumes that wavelength will be used. The y-axis unit will be taken from $A$. \n",
