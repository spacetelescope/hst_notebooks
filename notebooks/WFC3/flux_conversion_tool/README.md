This notebook provides a framework for users to convert between multiple magnitude and flux unit systems, and plot the results on the selected spectrum. This tool is based on the NICMOS unit conversion form and replaces the [HST Unit conversion tool](https://colortool.stsci.edu/unit-conversion/), which was developed in 2014. The updated tool incorporates the latest WFC3/UVIS ([WFC3 ISR 2021-04](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2021/WFC3_ISR_2021-04.pdf)) and WFC3/IR ([WFC3 ISR 2020-10](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2020/WFC3-ISR-2020-10.pdf)) photometric calibration as well as recent changes in the Vega spectrum of up to ~1.5% ([Bohlin et al. 2020](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab94b4)). See Section 9.5.2 of the [WFC3 Data Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3dhb) for more information.
