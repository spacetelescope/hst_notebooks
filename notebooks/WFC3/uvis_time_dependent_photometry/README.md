For UVIS images retrieved after October 15, 2020, new time-dependent photometry keyword values (PHOTFLAM, PHTFLAM1, PHTFLAM2 and PHTRATIO) are populated in the image header and must be applied separately for each observation epoch. This is a change from prior calibration, where a single set of keyword values were provided for each filter, independent of date. For more detail on the new calibration, see [WFC3 ISR 2021-04](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2021/WFC3_ISR_2021-04.pdf).

In this tutorial, we show how to use the time-dependent calibration to compute aperture photometry on UVIS calibrated, CTE-corrected images (flc.fits, hereafter FLC) obtained at three epochs, spanning a total range of ~8 years and showing a loss in sensitivity of ~2%. The repository includes a CSV file containing a list of FLCs and the centroid of the star in each image, as well as the UVIS Pixel Area Maps to correct for distortion when working with FLC data.

Alternately, the FLC science arrays may be 'equalized' to account for sensitivity changes prior to computing photometry, where a reference set of keywords may be then used for all images. This photometric 'equalization' must be performed before combining any set of FLC images with AstroDrizzle which span multiple epochs in time.
