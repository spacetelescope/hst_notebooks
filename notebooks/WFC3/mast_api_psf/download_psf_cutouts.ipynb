    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The WFC3 and WFPC2 PSF Databases are three databases (WFC3/UVIS, WFC3/IR, and WFPC2) of sources measured in every external observation from the instruments, excluding proprietary data. All sources were measured using [HST1PASS](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2022/WFC3-ISR-2022-05.pdf), a Fortran program that measures point sources using HST PSF models and one-pass photometry. These point sources are \"realizations\" of the PSF, meaning they can be used to construct detailed PSF models. [WFC3 ISR 2021-12](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2021/ISR_2021_12.pdf) (Dauphin et al. 2021) provides a detailed overview of the database pipeline and a statistical analysis of the databases up to 2021. As of August 2024, the databases have over 83.5 million sources, including both unsaturated and saturated sources. The databases are summarized below:\n",
    "- WFC3/UVIS: 33M sources (30M unsaturated and 3M saturated)\n",
    "- WFC3/IR: 25.5M sources (25.3M unsaturated and 0.2M saturated)\n",
    "- WFPC2: 25M sources (15M unsaturated and 10M saturated)\n",
    "\n",
    "The databases are available on the [MAST Portal](https://mast.stsci.edu/portal/Mashup/Clients/Mast/Portal.html) under the collections \"WFC3 PSF\" (with wavebands \"UVIS\" and \"IR\") and \"WFPC2 PSF\". By clicking \"Advanced Search\", the databases can be filtered and queried by various parameters, such as source position and flux. All of the searchable field options are described [here](https://mast.stsci.edu/api/v0/_w_f_c3__p_s_ffields.html). After completing the query, the sources' measurables (i.e. metadata) and cutouts centered on the source can be retrieved and downloaded, using either raw or calibrated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the MAST Portal is extremely effective for a variety of purposes, we introduce a programmatic way of downloading metadata and cutouts, which can be useful for downstream tasks and increasing data accessibility."
