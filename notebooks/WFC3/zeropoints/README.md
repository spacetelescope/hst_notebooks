This notebook shows how to calculate photometric zeropoints using the Python package `stsynphot` for any WFC3 detector, filter, date, or aperture. This tutorial is especially useful for calculating Vegamag zeropoints, which require an input spectrum. The notebook is also useful for computing time-dependent WFC3/UVIS zeropoints for any observation date, as the values listed in [WFC3 ISR 2021-04](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/wfc3/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/2021/WFC3_ISR_2021-04.pdf) are defined for the reference epoch. As of mid-2021, the WFC3/IR zeropoints are not time-dependent.
