    "# Getting HST Ephemeris and Related Data for an Observation\n",
    "## Worked Examples for an ACS/SBC Observation \n",
    "#### By Chris Clark (ESA/AURA, Space Telescope Science Institute; `cclark@stsci.edu`), last edited 28th March 2025\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through how to get various information about where HST is, and where it is pointing, in relation to Earth and the Sun, for a given observation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The methods laid out in this notebook do not necessarily represent the \"official\" way that one would extract these quantities from the full NASA engineering data. However, interacting with the engineering data can be non-trivial, and there is often limited documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, this notebook aims to provide ways to calculate various ephemeris (and related) quantities in ways that are reliable, whilst also still being relatively straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the examples laid out in this notebook use information available in the FITS header, and some use the JPL `Horizons` service or `pvlib` package. To run this notebook, you will require `astropy`, `astroquery`, and `pvlib` to be installed (along with their dependences).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will be using an observation from the ACS/SBC - namely `jec0c6aeq_flc.fits`. It's an observation of part of nearby galaxy NGC7793, looking at a bunch of young stars and star-forming regions. This file will be downloaded from MAST, and put in a directory your current working directory (in general, this will automatically be the same directory as the notebook itself, under standard notebook kernel server settings).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the methods demonstrated in this notebook *require* you to be working with a file associated with an individual expoure (ie, a `raw`, `flt`, or `flc` file). This is because a drizzled file, or other combined data product, will consist of data from different observations, where the telescope, Earth, and Sun will have been in different relative positions.\n",
