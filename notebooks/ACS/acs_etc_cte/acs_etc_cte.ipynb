    "\n",
    "The <a href=\"https://etc.stsci.edu/etc/input/acs/imaging/\">ACS Imaging Exposure Time Calculator (ETC)</a> is a powerful tool for users to determine the exposure time to reach a given signal-to-noise, or vice versa. However, the ETC does not take into account the impact that degraded Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE) has on the measured brightnesses of targets. In reality, the degraded CTE of the WFC detectors leads to sources being fainter than expected, and this effect increases for fainter backgrounds, fainter sources, and increased number of pixel transfers during the read-out process (see e.g., <a href=\"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022acs..rept....6C/abstract\">ACS ISR 2022-06</a>). This tutorial will guide you through the steps needed to assess the impact of degraded CTE and how to adjust exposure times to recover a desired signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Throughout, we assume users are working with the FLT products produced by the ACS calibration pipeline.\n",

    "This tells us our V=23 star looks like a V=23.30 star. Plug that into the ETC with our exposure time, and see that <a href=\"https://etc.stsci.edu/etc/results/ACS.im.2252200/\">the predicted SNR is 10.2</a>, close to our desired SNR=10. It is slightly higher because the exposure times in this three-exposure setup are slightly longer than the exposure times of our two-exposure setup, meaning source and background counts per exposure are slightly higher, meaning artificial dimming from degraded CTE is slightly less severe. One could iterate further, possibly reducing exposure times a bit a still obtain SNR~10, but for the purposes of this example, we will stop here."

Integrated brightnesses (e.g. using large apertures) are generally reliable as long as backgrounds are above 20e-/pixel and targets are brighter than ~300 e- per exposure, but brightness measurements on smaller scales suffer measurable losses. ***At this point, there is no correction formula for extended sources like there is for point sources***, but preliminary analysis has shown that the point-source CTE correction formula provides corrected brightnesses for extended sources that are broadly consistent with their true brightnesses in 3 or 5 pixel radius apertures, at least for sources with sizes ranging from 10s to a few hundred pixels. \n",
