    "Subarray observations for the ACS/WFC allow users to read out only selected areas of the CCDs. This can be useful, for example, when using certain filters that heavily vignette the field of view or when the target subtends only a small area on the sky. Subarray frames have a faster readout time compared to the full-frame as well as a smaller data volume, which allows users to pack many more exposures in a single orbit and reduce the number of buffer dumps.\n",

    "### Subarray Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "A comprehensive summary of the subarray readout configuations can be found in [ACS ISR 2017-03](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/isr1703.pdf). For subarray data taken prior to Servicing Mission 4 (SM4), the 2-D bias and dark images are cut out of the full-frame reference files during calibration using `calacs`. However, after SM4 the clock speed of the subarray readout was different than the full-frame, resulting in the need to acquire bias images in each subarray mode to match observations. The subarray definitions in the flight software were updated at the start of Cycle 24 to match the clock speed of the readout, which solves the need for separate bias imaging. Most noticeably, the new subarray definitions allow users to reduce the number of rows in the image, but the number of columns will always be 2072 (2048 + 24 bias prescan columns). This is markedly different from the pre-Cycle 24 format in which both the number of columns and rows were reduced. For example, the old 512 subarray, which measured 512 rows x 534 columns in the raw image, is now 512 x 2072. In addition, the post-Cycle 24 2K subarray also includes 20 rows of virtual overscan to match the full-frame readout."

    "### Differences in Calibration Steps for Subarray Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The installation of the Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) during SM4 imparted a low-frequency, row-correlated noise component to all post-SM4 ACS/WFC observations (\"striping\"; [ACS ISR 2011-05](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/isr1105.pdf)). Full-frame images are corrected for this striping effect as part of the `ACSCCD` step in `CALACS` using the bias prescan areas adjacent to each readout amplifier. This correction leverages the fact that the striping is continuous across amplifier regions to measure the striping level on the unexposed prescan pixels. As only one bias prescan region is available with subarray observations, stripe removal is not performed for subarray data. For subarray data taken prior to Cycle 24, users may choose to apply the striping correction to 2K subarrays, which will use the single bias prescan and sky-exposed pixels on the far side of the image opposite the prescan to estimate the striping level, however this is scene dependent and may produce unsatisfactory results (see the documentation for [acs_destripe_plus](http://acstools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/acs_destripe_plus.html) and Example 1 below). All subarray data taken using the new post-Cycle 24 subarray defintions may use this de-striping technique with the same caveat regarding scene dependence.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Charge transfer efficiency (CTE)]() loss is typically corrected in the ACS data pipeline by the pixel-based CTE code `ACSCTE`, which is controlled by the `PCTECORR` calibration switch in FITS file primary headers and is configured by the `PCTETAB` reference file. Due to concerns about amplifying the striping noise that is not removed in subarray data, these data are not automatically corrected for CTE loss by `CALACS`. Users are given the choice to apply the CTE correction to subarray data using the `acs_destripe_plus` code."

    "User-defined (or \"custom\") subarray data were an available-but-unsupported mode prior to SM4 (and then a restricted mode until Cycle 24 when their use was discontinued), however the calibration of these data is complicated within `CALACS`. The `CALACS` data pipeline utilizes the `OSCNTAB` reference file to define the physcial bias prescan and virtual bias overscan regions. During the `BLEVCORR` step in `ACSCCD`, the physical prescan regions are used to subtract the bias level from each row, and then the prescan and overscan regions are trimmed from the image. Because custom subarray data can include any or none of the prescan columns, they are not defined in `OSCNTAB`. We show how to update the table with a new definition for a custom subarray observation in the example below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subtraction of the 2-D bias (\"superbias\") image from custom subarray data is also complicated by two factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pre-SM4: If the data do not contain any bias prescan columns, the `BLEVCORR` step will be skipped and the bias level will be entirely removed using the superbias image, which must be made from bias frames taken as part of the observing program to include the full bias level. This is in contrast to subarray data with bias prescan columns that use a cutout of the superbias image from the full-frame reference file.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Post-SM4: As discussed above, differences in the clocking rate between subarray and full-frame observations taken after SM4 require subarray data to have corresponding bias frames taken with the same subarray readout definitions to create the superbias image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [CRDS](https://hst-crds.stsci.edu) is unable to match appropriately sized superbias reference files to custom subarray images.
