    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The charge transfer efficiency (CTE) of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) Wide Field Channel (WFC) has been decreasing over the lifetime of the instrument. Radiation damage from cosmic rays and other sources leads to charge traps within the detector. These traps remove electrons from charge packets as they are transferred between rows of the detector, and release the electrons in subsequent pixels. This causes flux to be removed from bright features and released into pixels behind the features (relative to the row closest to the amplifier), creating bright trails.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pixel-based CTE correction model for the ACS/WFC detector is fully described in [Anderson & Bedin (2010)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PASP..122.1035A/abstract), and a recent update to the model is presented in [ACS ISR 2018-04](http://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/acs/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/isr1804.pdf). The model is based on an empirical determination of the number and depth of charge traps distributed across the detector. It simulates detector readout of an input image, removes the result from the input, and iterates five times. In this way, a reverse model is successively approximated by the forward model. Electrons released in trails are removed and added back to the bright feature in which they originated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pixel-based correction was implemented in the calibration pipeline code for ACS (`CALACS`) in 2012 and the algorithm was updated and improved in 2018. The CTE correction step within `CALACS` runs on bias-corrected images, `blv_tmp` files, producing `blc_tmp` files, which lack the bright trails due to poor CTE. Further calibration, including dark correction and flat-fielding, produces `flt` and `flc` files from the `blv_tmp` and `blc_tmps` files, respectively. For more information on calibration of ACS/WFC data, see the [ACS Data Handbook](http://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/acs/documentation/other-documents/_documents/acs_dhb.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Users desiring to more fully understand the effects of pixel-based CTE correction on their science may wish to run the forward model (i.e., the detector readout simulation) on data containing artificial stars. Here we demonstrate two methods for running the CTE forward model. In [Option A](#option-a), we begin with an observed `flc` image, whereas in [Option B](#option-b), we begin with a `raw` image and generate synthetic data on which to run the forward model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: The forward model, like the CTE correction step in `CALACS`, adds 10% of the difference between the input and output `SCI` extensions to the `ERR` extensions to account for uncertainty in the CTE model. Below, we provide guidance for properly repopulating the `ERR` extensions of forward-modeled data.**"

New-mode subarrays were added to the HST flight software at the beginning of Cycle 24. These subarrays have `APERTURE` keywords of the type `WFC1A-512, WFC1A-1K, WFC1A-2K`, etc. Old-mode subarrays have `APERTURE` keywords of the type `WFC1-512, WFC1-1K, WFC1-2K`, etc. WFC apertures are also listed in [Table 7.7 of the ACS IHB](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/display/ACSIHB/7.7+ACS+Apertures#id-7.7ACSApertures-table7.7).\n",
