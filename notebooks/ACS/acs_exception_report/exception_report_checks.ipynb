    "[HST exception reports](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/observing/post-observation/exception-reports) are sent via email to the PIs of programs that encounter observing problems during a given visit. Often times these are due to guide star acquisition failures, but there can be other causes, including unexpected safings of the telescope. Sometimes a report is sent out of an abundance of caution, in that the observing problem in question did not affect the data in the exception report. If you receive one of these reports, it is highly recommended that you inspect your data and the observing logs immediately in order to determine if your data quality is affected in any way. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you determine your data are compromised by an observing problem, you can file a [Hubble Observation Problem Report (HOPR)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/observing/post-observation/reporting-problems). There is a 90-day time limit from the date the data were made available to file a HOPR.\n",
