    "## Introduction\n",
    "The root-N approximation for error calculation is ubiquitous in astronomy and is appropriate for a wide-range of observing scenarios. The root-N approximation means that the 1-$\\sigma$ uncertainty associated with any measurement of counts (i.e., electrons on a CCD detector) can be approximated by just taking the square root of the number of counts, $N$. However, this approximation *does* break down for low counts $\\lesssim10$ (inclusive of dark rate and read noise) sometimes seen in UV observations with instruments like HST/STIS and HST/COS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will look at where and why the root-N approximation breaks down, how the calculate appropriate Poisson confidence intervals, and how to apply that to HST/STIS observations. Some of these issues have been address in the HST/COS pipeline, CalCOS, so we compare to that in Section 5 as well.\n",

    "As you can see, the pipeline uncertainties are mostly just the square root of the counts.

In the extraction routines, the pipeline defaults to an extraction height of 11 pixels, so the dark rate is still adding less than a count per wavelength. In the NUV, however, dark rates can be as much as 0.002 counts per second per pixel, which can result in dozens of \"extra\" counts and thus do need to be taken into account in the errors.

    "\n",
    "Because we are measuring a discrete, positive number of counts when we read out an astronomical detector, our measurement comes from a Poisson disstribution. The uncertainty associated with a measurement of a variable described by a Poisson distribution is very often assumed to be the square-root of the value measured, as seen above. This is because the Poisson distribution is a univariate distrbution, defined only by its mean, $\\lambda$. The probability of $N$ events is defined as $\\frac{\\lambda^N*e^{-\\lambda}}{N!}$.\n",
    "\n",

    "However, the assumption of \"square-root N\" uncertainties is only valid for large $N$. In this large-$n$ regime, the Poisson distribution is relatively symmetric and well-approximated by a Gaussian distribution with standard deviation of $\\sqrt{N}$. At low-$N$, however, the discrete and positive nature of the Poisson distribution results in the distribution becoming highly asymmetric and the Gaussian approximation breaks down.

To calculate $\\lambda_u$ and $\\lambda_l$, various analytic approximations have been developed based on numerical tabulations, as in [Gehrels (1986)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...303..336G/abstract).

To get the correct confidence interval method, we choose \"frequentist-confidence\", which recreates these limits closely (confusingly, don't use the \"sherpagehrels\" method, which just uses the upper limit symmetrically).\n",

Futhermore, and importantly, at N=0, the root-N approximation says that our uncertinaity goes to zero, which is clearly absurd! If we don't measure any counts on a pixel, we shouldn't somehow be inifintely sure there were no photons there.

    "You can see that the COS pipeline gives lower bound uncertainties lower than root-N, but the upper bound uncertainties are significantly higher than root-N (coming from the \"extra +1\" in the Poisson upper confidence interval, related to the \"continuity correction\" between the discrete Poisson and continuous Gaussian distributions). This is crucial for quantifying non-detections. For example, the sorts of upper limits you can place on something like the FUV continuum of an M-dwarf can come down to how you treat these sorts of uncertainties.\n",

    "As of 04/2025, the `calstis` pipeline calculates all errors according to the root-N approximation. We have therefore implemented a `stistools` function, `poisson_err.poisson_err` that calculates Poisson confidence intervals for STIS data. The function adds columns with the new errors to any x1d file.\n",

    "In the NUV, long exposures generally have enough dark counts to be in the regime where the Gaussian approximation is at least somewhat valid. For short exposures, however, measured counts may indeed be and users may want to opt for a Poisson confidence interval. Because the FUV dark rate is significantly lower than in the NUV, users will want to add the dark counts to the measured number of counts for NUV observations before calculating the Poisson confidence intervals, which is done in `poisson_err.poisson_err` by reconstructing the measured counts from the NET_ERROR, which will include the wavelength-specific dark counts as well."

    "Upon further inspection, it was found that this bug was related to these Poisson confidence intervals! When `inttag` fills the error arrays for the sub-exposure, rather than taking the square-root of the counts (as the pipeline would normally do), *inttag* actually used to use Astropy's poisson_confidence_interval. Unfortunately, `inttag` uses the incorrect method, choosing \"sherpagehrels\" over the more correct \"frequentist-confidence\". As we explored above, \"sherpagehrels\" actually gives symmetric lower and upper bounds, fixed to the upper bound calculated in [Gehrels (1986)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1986ApJ...303..336G/abstract). This was probably originally done because there was only room for one value in the error array, so the more conservative upper confidence interval was chosen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the Poisson errors are calculated at the pixel level, rather than after spectral extraction where the counts have been added up along columns. In the root-N approximation, this doesn't matter, because adding the root-N errors in quadrature is equivalent to taking the square root of the summed column:\n",

    "$\\sqrt{\\sum_i{(\\sqrt{n_i})^2}} = \\sqrt{\\sum_i{n_i}} = \\sqrt{N}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $n_i$ is the count measured on the $i$th pixel of a column and $N$ is the count for the entire column. In other words, it doesn't matter how the counts are arranged on a pixel column, all that matters is their sum. **But this is not true for Poisson errors.** Whether all your counts are centered on one pixel or whether your counts are distributed evenly accross your extraction window will change what the uncertainty on your spectrum is! \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that in the following example, where we have to scenarios for how the flux is distributed along a column: either all the flux is in one pixel or it is evenly distributed. We then calculate the uncertainty on the extracted flux using the root-N approximation, first adding the error of each pixel in quadrature and then by summing the column and *then* calculating the error. These two methods give the same answer in both scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we do the same thing but using Poisson confidence intervals with `astropy`. Now, when we calculate the errors pixel-by-pixel or on the extracted flux, we get different answers depending on how the counts are distributed and depending on how we add them up!"
