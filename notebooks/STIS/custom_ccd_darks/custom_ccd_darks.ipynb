    "## Introduction\n",
    "In the Calstis pipline for calibrating STIS CCD data, one of the steps is dark signal substraction, which removes the dark signal (count rate created in the detector in the absence of photons from the sky) from the uncalibrated science image based on reference file. Usually, the Calstis pipline uses the default dark reference file specified in the 0-extension header of the uncalibrated science image fits file. But for some faint sources, it is necessary to customize the dark reference for the observations to remove the hot pixels in the science image. In this notebook, we will go through how to create dark reference files using the Python refstis library.\n",
