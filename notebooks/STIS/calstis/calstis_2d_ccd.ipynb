A raw STIS CCD image in full frame unbinned mode has 19 leading and trailing columns of serial physical overscan in the AXIS1 (x direction), and 20 rows of virtual overscan in the AXIS2 (y direction); therefore the size of the uncalibrated and unbinned full framge CCD image is 1062(serial) $\\times$ 1044(parallel) pixels, with 1024 * 1024 exposed science pixels.\n",

The exposures are specified by the number of iterations NRPTEXP or CRSPLIT parameters. The CRCORR step sums the individual CRSPLIT exposures in an associated dataset, producing a single cosmic ray rejected file. The CRCORR contains the following steps:\n",
    " - Forms a stack of images to be combined(the CRSPLIT or NRPTEXP exposures in the input file).\n",
    " - Forms an initial guess image (minimum or median).\n",
    " - Forms a summed CR-rejected image, using the guess image to reject high and low values in the stack, based on sigma and the radius parameter that signifies whether to reject pixels neighboring cosmic ray impacts.\n",
    " - Iterates, using different (usually decreasing) rejection thresholds to produce a new guess image at each iteration.\n",
    " - Produces a final cosmic ray rejected image (_crj), including science, data quality, and error extensions, which is the sum of the input images. Then updates various header keywords.\n",
    " - Flags the data quality arrays of the individual (non-CR-rejected) input files to indicate where an outlier has been found (pixels that were rejected because of cosmic ray hits can be identified by looking for data quality bit = 14 in the _flt file)."

The DQ extension is updated to reflect bad pixels in the reference files, and the ERR extension is updated to reflect the application of the flat.
