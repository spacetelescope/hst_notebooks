    "## Introduction\n",
    "There are two types of STIS target acquisitions: ACQ and ACQ/PEAKUP. The ACQ is used in almost all STIS observations to center the target. The ACQ/PEAKUP can be taken after the ACQ to further refine the centering and is recommended for observations using slits with widths less than 0.2‚Äù. In this notebook, we will go through the steps for ACQ observations, and explore some success and failure cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For ACQ observations, the target acquisition data has three science extensions:\n",
    "- Before Coarse Slew\n",
    "- Before Fine Slew\n",
    "- 0.2$\\times$0.2 Reference Aperture with HITM lamp\n",
    "\n",
    "The first science extension (Coarse Phase) of the acquisition raw file is an image of target in the target acquisition sub-array based on initial pointing. Then the coarse centering is performed: the software determines the position of the target with a flux weighted pointing algorithm, and calculates the slew needed to place the target at a reference point in the target acquisition sub-array; the coarse centered image is stored in the second science extension (Fine Phase). The next step is to perform fine centering: a 32 $\\times$ 32 pixel image of the reference aperture is obtained and stored in the third science extension (Reference Aperture), the location of the aperture on the detector is determined, and a fine slew is performed to center the taret in the reference aperture (to place the object precisely in a slit).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on ACQ target acquisition, see [`Evaluating Target Acquisitions and Guiding`](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/stisdhb/chapter-5-stis-data-analysis/5-2-evaluating-target-acquisitions-and-guiding)."
