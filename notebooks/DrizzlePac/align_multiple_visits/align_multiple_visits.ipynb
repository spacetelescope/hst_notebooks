In this example, we will adjust some of these to parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, none of the source finding parameters were adjusted. `TweakReg`, by default, looks for sources which are 4-sigma above the background, but this `threshold` value is too low, since the catalogs contain ~60,000 objects per chip in each frame, and ~6500 matched sources between each exposure. Setting the `threshold` to a very low value generally does *not* translate to a better solution, since all sources are weighted equally when computing fits to match catalogs. This is especially relevant for ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS data where CTE tails can shift the centroid position slightly along the readout direction for faint sources and potentially bias the fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this test, the `threshold` value is adjusted to a larger value, and the `peakmax` value is set to 70,000 electrons to exclude full-well saturated objects for gain=2. `TweakReg` now finds a more reasonable number of sources per ACS chip (~700).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are other source finding parameters that can be adjusted and that you may need to adjust. For example, you may need to also adjust `searchrad` if your images have large offsets."

    "In this example, we imported and ran the `AstroDrizzle` task on our input images, which were previously aligned with `TweakReg`. By setting `configobj` to None, we ensured that `AstroDrizzle` was not picking up any existing configuration files and parameters were restored to default values. We then set a select few parameters to non-default values:\n",
    "   1. `output = 'f606w_combined'` : Output file name root (which will be appended with various suffixes). Defaults to input file name.\n",
    "   2. `driz_sep_bits = '256, 64, 16'` : Data quality flags in the `flt.fits` file, which were set during calibration, can be used as bit mask when drizzling. The user may specify which bit values should actually be considered \"good\" and included in image combination. In `astrodrizzle`, this parameter may be given as the sum of those DQ flags or as a comma-separated list, as shown in this example. In this example, 64 and 16 are set, so that both warm pixels and stable hot pixels, which are corrected by the dark, are treated as valid input pixels. To avoid flagging saturated pixels as CR's, dq 256 is also set as a valid input pixel.\n",
    "   3. `driz_cr_corr = True` : When set to True, the task will create both a cosmic ray mask image (suffix `crmask.fits`) and a clean version of the original input images (suffix `crclean.fits`), where flagged pixels are replaced by pixels from the blotted median. It is strongly recommended that the quality of the cosmic ray masks be verified by blinking the original `flt.fits` input image with both the cosmic ray-cleaned image (`crclean.fits`) and the cosmic-ray mask (`crmask.fits`).\n",
    "   4. `final_bits = '256, 64, 16'` : Similar to `driz_sep_bits`, but for the last step when all the input images are combined. To avoid filling the cores of saturated pixels with NaN, dq 256 is set as a valid input pixel.\n",
    "   5. `clean = False` : intermediate output files (e.g masks) will be kept. If True, only main outputs will be kept. Also see `in_memory` to control this behavior.\n",
    "   6. `configobj = None` : ignore any custom config files and refresh all parameters to default values.\n",
    "   \n",
    "`AstroDrizzle` has a large number of parameters, which are [described here](https://drizzlepac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/drizzlepac_api/astrodrizzle.html). Running `AstroDrizzle` using default parameter values is not recommended, as these defaults may not provide optimal science products. Users should also inspect the quality of the sky subtraction and cosmic ray rejection. For dithered data, users may experiment with the output `final_scale` and `final_pixfrac` parameters in the `final_drizzle` step. For more details, see the notebook in this repository to 'Optimize Image Sampling'."
