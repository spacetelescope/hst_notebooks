    "Even though Hubble has a small field of view, satellites are commonly captured in images. The cosmic ray rejection algorithm in Astrodrizzle is not well suited to eliminate satellite trails, and the affected adjacent pixels that make up their wings leave ugly blemishes in stacked images. \n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this problem, the pixels around satellite trails need to be marked as bad in the affected images. There are several ways to accomplish this goal. The ACS Team developed multiple algorithms to automatically detect and mask satellite trails. The newest is a module called `findsat_mrt` and is decribed in [ISR ACS 2022-08](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/acs/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/isr2208.pdf). The 'readthedocs' page can be found here: [MRT-based Satellite Trail Detection](https://acstools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/findsat_mrt.html). The second module is called `satdet` and is described in [ISR ACS 2016-01](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/acs/documents/isrs/isr1601.pdf).  The 'readthedocs' page for the software can be found here: [Satellite Trails Detection](https://acstools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/satdet.html). `findsat_mrt` has the benefit of significantly improved sensitivity over `satdet` but it is more computationally demanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Masks can also be made manually using DS9 regions. While not as convenient, making masks manually allows you to mask not only satellites, but also any other anomalies with odd shapes (e.g. dragon's breath, glint, blooming). \n",
    "\n",
    "All of these methods are demonstrated below. To aid users, we have provided examples using both ACS/WFC and WFC3/UVIS imaging data, although most of the tools shown in this notebook can be applied to any imaging data."
