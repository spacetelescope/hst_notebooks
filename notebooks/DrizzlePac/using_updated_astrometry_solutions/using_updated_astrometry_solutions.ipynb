    "## Introduction\n",
    "<a id=\"intro\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in December 2019, improved astrometric solutions for ACS and WFC3 images are available in the World Coordinate System (WCS) of the exposure file (`flt.fits` and `flc.fits`) FITS headers, with alternate WCS solutions appended as additional headerlet extensions. These solutions are also available as separate [headerlet](https://stwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/headerlet.html) FITS files which may be downloaded and applied to the FITS images. <br>  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<b>This notebook shows how to examine different WCS solutions contained in the FITS images and how to improve the relative alignment of exposures in the F225W and F336W filters which were taken in the same visit but which have different active WCS solutions.</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "During the calibration portion of the pipeline processing, the drizzlepac software calls the [updatewcs](https://stwcs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/astrometry_utils.html#usage) module to populate the WCS headerlet extensions in the FITS images and then sets the 'bestSolutionID' as the active WCS.  The astrometry database captures every unique WCS solution for a given dataset cataloged by 'ipppssoot' and includes WCS's derived from standard (HST) and Hubble Advanced Products (HAP). This gives us a complete  history of the active WCS over time and these solutions can change as the alignment software is improved, as new  distortion reference files are delivered, and/or as new reference catalogs become available.  (A re-alignment is performed ONLY when there is a new distortion solution or absolute reference catalog.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n",
    "<b>NOTE:</b> While some datasets may have WCS solutions which are aligned to an external reference catalog, such as Gaia eDR3, GSC v2.4.2 or 2MASS, other datasets (even in the same visit) may not! Thus, it is crucial to check which WCS solution is active for all of the exposures. The easiest way to do this is to examine the WCSNAME keyword in the header of the SCI extensions. <br>  \n",
    "<br>    \n",
    "<b>Alternatively, a more accurate WCS solution may be available in the HAP Single Visit Mosaic (SVM) products created by MAST. In this workflow, the pipeline first aligns all of the images in a given visit and second aligns the entire group to an external reference catalog.<b>  Here, we show how to download the SVM headerlets and apply them to the FITS data to improve the relative aligment prior to running AstroDrizzle.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information alternate WCS solutions, see [Section 4.5](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/drizzpac/chapter-4-astrometric-information-in-the-header/4-5-absolute-astrometry) of the Drizzlepac Handbook.

In general, it is always preferred to have consistent WCS solutions across exposures, especially from the same visit.
