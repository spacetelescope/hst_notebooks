DrizzlePac Notebooks
=================

An updated set of HST drizzling and alignment tutorials are now available and compatible with the latest STScI distributed software environment [stenv](https://stenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). These notebooks include a new recommended workflow for MAST data retrieved after December 2019, which includes updated astrometric information included as additional FITS extensions.  Alternatively, the new World Coordinate System (WCS) solutions may be downloaded directly from MAST as small 'headerlet' files and applied to existing data. For example, the Hubble Advanced Product 'Single Visit Mosaics' may have improved relative alignment for different filters acquired in the same visit. These headerlets may be used to update the WCS in the FITS images prior to drizzling. For details on the alignment of HST data in MAST, see Section 4.5 [Absolute Astrometry](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/drizzpac/chapter-4-astrometric-information-in-the-header/4-5-absolute-astrometry) in the DrizzlePac Handbook.  

In each notebook, a sample WFC3 or ACS dataset is used to demonstrate how to download the calibrated data, inspect the quality of the alignment, and test whether the observations need to be realigned before combining the data with `AstroDrizzle`. Different workflows are illustrated to enhance the scientific value of the drizzled data products using advanced reprocessing techniques. These notebooks highlight different use cases, e.g. images acquired using small sub-pixel dithers to optimally sample the PSF versus those acquired in multiple pointings to generate large mosaics on the sky.

The notebooks available in this repository include:

For additional assistance with DrizzlePac tools, users may submit a ticket to the [STScI Help Desk](https://stsci.service-now.com/hst?id=hst_index) and should select the DrizzlePac category.


Installation
------------

It is recommended to clone the entire repository. To do so, run the following command in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/spacetelescope/hst_notebooks
```

`stenv` is the preferred base virtual environment for running WFC3 Noteboks since 
it contains libraries necessary for processing and analyzing data from the Hubble 
Space Telescope (HST) and the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). To install, see 
[stenv readthedocs](https://stenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or 
[stenv GitHub](https://github.com/spacetelescope/stenv). 

`hst_notebooks/notebooks_env` is the default virtual environment for HST Notebooks, 
which contains the same scientific computing libraries in `stenv`, but not the HST and
JWST libraries. This environment can also be used as a base, but is not recommended.

In addition, each notebook contains a `requirements.txt` file that needs to be
installed before running the notebooks. Here is a common set of commands to run 
before executing the notebooks (assuming your virtual environment is activated):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install notebook
```

With the environment activated and additional libraries installed based on the
individual requirement files, you will be able to complete the notebooks.
