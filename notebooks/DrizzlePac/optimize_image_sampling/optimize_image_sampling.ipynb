    "This example was written to help users better understand the subtleties in improving image sampling for dithered data. One of the powers of the *drizzling* algorithm is that, given properly dithered images, it can restore much of the information lost due to undersampled images ([Fruchter and Hook, 2002](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/338393/pdf)). \n",

    "\n",
    "Before drizzling can be performed, a plate scale for the output image should be chosen. This will usually be dictated by the science needs. In theory, critical sampling of a PSF occurs with 2.355 pixels. The FWHM of the WFC3/IR detector at 1600 nm is ~0.151\" (Table 7.5 of [WFC Instrument Handbook](https://hst-docs.stsci.edu/wfc3ihb/chapter-7-ir-imaging-with-wfc3/7-6-ir-optical-performance)). Using these values, a plate scale of 0.065\"/pix will be selected for the drizzled output frame, approximately half of the native plate scale (0.1283\"/pix). \n",
    "\n",
    "The mechanism by which the *drizzle* algorithm improves sampling in the output image is by shrinking the input pixels before adding them to the output pixel grid (see Figure 2 in [Fruchter and Hook (2002)](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/338393/pdf)). In practice this process is controlled in the `AstroDrizzle` package by adjusting the `final_pixfrac` parameter, which is the fractional size of the pixel to be used. \n",
    "Below `AstroDrizzle` is called twice. The first time, no changes are made to the plate scale or the size of the drop. In the second call, the plate scale and pixfrac are reduced. For a four point dither stack, a `final_pixfrac` value of 0.8 is usually optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we get some recommended values for drizzling from the MDRIZTAB reference file.  The parameters in this file are different for each detector and are based on the number of input frames. These are a good starting point for drizzling and may be adjusted accordingly.\n",
    "\n",

For example, if the number of images is greater than four, the value used for `final_pixfrac` could be smaller since more images are available to fill in holes in the output grid. On the other hand, it is possible that no dithering was used during the observations.

    "The `final_pixfrac` value has to be small enough to avoid degrading the combined output image, but large enough that when all images are \"dropped\" onto the final frame, coverage of the output frame is fairly uniform. In general, `final_pixfrac` should be slightly larger than the final output scale to allow some \"spillover\" to adjacent pixels. This will help avoid \"holes\" in the final product when a given pixel has been flagged as \"bad\" in several frames. As a rule of thumb, statistics performed on the drizzled weight image in the region of interest should yield an RMS value (standard deviation) that is less than 20% of the median value. This threshold is a balance between the benefits of improving the image resolution at the expense of increasing noise in the background."
