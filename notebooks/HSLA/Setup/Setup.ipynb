    "The Hubble Advanced Spectral Products (HASP) and Hubble Spectroscopic Legacy Archive (HSLA) combine data taken with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) into high-quality spectra with broad wavelength coverage (from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared if the data exist) that are publicly available to the scientific community.  HASP combines all of the STIS and COS data for each target within a single program.  HSLA combines all of the STIS and COS data in the MAST archive -- across multiple programs -- into a single spectrum for each target.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same script is used by both projects; it is available for use by observers who wish to produce custom products beyond those provided by HASP and HSLA through MAST.  Briefly, the code co-adds all of the spectra taken with the same grating, then splices together (or abuts) the spectra from multiple gratings into a single spectrum with the broadest possible wavelength range.  In particular, the script combines multiple orders from the STIS echelle modes and multiple central-wavelength settings for a single STIS or COS grating, tasks that that the current STIS and COS pipelines do not perform.  For a detailed explanation of the logic used to combine spectra, see the [HASP](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/cos/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/ISR2024-01.pdf) and [HSLA](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/cos/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/ISR2025-18.pdf) ISRs.\n",
