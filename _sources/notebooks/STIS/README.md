# STIS Notebooks

## Jupyter Notebook Tutorials for Working with Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) Data and Observation Planning.
The [Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/stis) (STIS) is an instrument on board the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/about) (HST). This is a repository of interactive tutorials for working with STIS data and planning observations.  A complete list of available tools can be found on the [STIS data and software tools website](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/stis/data-analysis-and-software-tools).

## Before Running a Notebook
Before running these examples you **must** follow the general instructions on creating an environment that can run the notebooks, shown in STScI HST Notebook Repository HQ page under [Installation Instructions](https://spacetelescope.github.io/hst_notebooks/index.html).

| view_data               | Viewing STIS Data                                      | The tutorial introduces handling STIS Data extensions, including examining Data Quality Flags. Several strategies explore how to visually examine STIS Data within a notebook to reproduce plots and tables. A section on using TIME-TAG mode data shows how to construct a flux plot and generate ACCUM images from TIME-TAG data with the stistools with the int_tag tool. A section on the STIS Gratings Echelle mode data shows how to display the echelle image and plot echelles by spectral order. | [view_data.ipynb](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hst_notebooks/tree/main/notebooks/STIS/view_data)                                             | [view_data.html](https://spacetelescope.github.io/hst_notebooks/notebooks/STIS/view_data/view_data.html)                                                                              |


Each folder has an `HTML` file that can be opened in a browser after cloning this repository. The `HTML` file is identical to the notebook, except they contain output plots and tables.
