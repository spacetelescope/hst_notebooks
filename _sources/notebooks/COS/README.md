# COS Notebooks 

## Jupyter Notebook Walkthroughs of Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) Data Processing
The [Cosmic Origins Spectrograph](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/cos) (COS) is an instrument on the [Hubble Space Telescope](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/about) (HST).
This is a repository of interactive walkthrough guides to common COS data procedures. It is intended for any and all COS data users: from undergraduates, to professional astronomers, to the general public.


## Before Running a Notebook
Before running these examples you **must** follow the general instructions on creating an environment that can run the notebooks, shown in STScI HST Notebook Repository HQ page under [Installation Instructions](https://spacetelescope.github.io/hst_notebooks/index.html).


## Current Notebooks

If you don't want to run the Notebooks for yourself but just want to see rendered html versions of the Notebooks, *(with outputs,)* you may use the rendered `html` file.
