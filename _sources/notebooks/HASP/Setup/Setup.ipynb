    "The Hubble Advanced Spectral Products (HASP) code is a script that co-adds spectra of the same target within programs. This software is able to co-add data taken with the spectrographs onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST); the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) and the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS). The Hubble Spectroscopic Legacy Archive (HSLA) uses this script to co-add these instruments’ data from the MAST archive to create high-quality spectra with a broad wavelength coverate (whenever possible from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared) that is publicly available for the scientific community. These custom co-addition notebooks will instruct users on how to produce their own co-adds in cases where the MAST archive data needs special processing or is rejected by the default filters used in the co-add script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script first co-adds the observations for each grating for a given program, then it combines all gratings for the observation set. Finally, it co-adds the spectra of each observation set in the program to produce a fully co-added spectra for each target in a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses primarily on the installation of the co-add code, and provides a quick overview on its usage. To see an example of downloading COS and STIS datasets, running the script, and analyzing the output, please check out our notebook CoaddTutorial.ipynb."
