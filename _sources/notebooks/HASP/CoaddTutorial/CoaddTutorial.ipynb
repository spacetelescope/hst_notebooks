    "The [Hubble Advanced Spectral Products (HASP) code](https://github.com/spacetelescope/hasp) is a script that co-adds spectra of the same target within programs. This software is able to co-add data taken with the spectrographs onboard the [Hubble Space Telescope (HST)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst); the [Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/stis) and the [Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)](https://www.stsci.edu/hst/instrumentation/cos). The [Hubble Spectroscopic Legacy Archive (HSLA)](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/hst/hasp) uses this script to co-add these instruments’ data from [The Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/) to create high-quality spectra with a broad wavelength coverage (whenever possible from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared) that is publicly available for the scientific community. These custom co-addition notebooks will instruct users on how to produce their own co-adds in cases where the MAST archive data needs special processing or is rejected by the default filters used in the co-add script.\n",
    "\n",
    "The script first co-adds the observations for each grating for a given program, then it combines all gratings for the observation set. Finally, it co-adds the spectra of each observation set in the program to produce a fully co-added spectra for each target in a program. Please check out the [COS 2024-01 ISR](https://www.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/www/files/home/hst/instrumentation/cos/documentation/instrument-science-reports-isrs/_documents/ISR2024-01.pdf) for more information about HASP. \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show users how to download data from MAST, run the co-add script, understand the output files and inspect the abutted data by plotting flux as a function of wavelength. It will also show users how to change the flux threshold flag.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 5. Changing the Threshold Flag\n",
    "\n",
    "The flux threshold flag is an optional flag that can be used to change the number of files that are co-added based on the flux of each spectra. When determining which files to abut, the script first creates a general co-add using all of the input files, and then iterates through each file to calculate the scaled median deviation. The script rejects a file if: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left\\langle{\\frac{F_{x1d}(i) - F_{coadd(i)}}{\\sigma_{x1d}(i)}}\\right\\rangle{} < \\frac{C_{thresh}}{\\sqrt{N_{pix}}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the equation, the median deviation from the co-add is $F_{x1d}(i) - F_{coadd(i)}$, the uncertainty per\n",
    "wavelength bin of the input spectrum is $\\sigma_{x1d}(i)$ and $N_{pix}$ is the number of wavelength bins for a given mode. Essentially, the scaled median deviation is the dispersion that quantifies the data quality (DQ) flag pixel spread for a spectrum that is less sensitive to outliers and size variations. The script will reject all files containing segments with scaled median deviation less than (i.e. more negative than) the threshold (the default is -50). For example, raising the threshold to -25 will abut less files than the default threshold of -50. Likewise, lowering the threshold to -100 will include more files in the dataset to be co-added. \n",
    "\n",
    "An important thing to note about changing the threshold is that including more files increases the SNR of your co-added spectra but decreases the flux accuracy. The threshold value may be altered if a user's science case is not dependent on the accuracy of a dataset's absolute flux. For example, if you have a large dataset of a bright target (i.e. a standard star), then you can lower the threshold to include more files in the abutment since the spread of data quality between each file is minimal. Conversely, if you have a dataset of a dim target, or a dataset with many poor observations, then you will want to raise the threshold to only include the best data out of the dataset.\n",
